Hello, I'm Ewan.
<br>
<br>I'm a semi-selftaught C++ programmer with an interest in game design.
<br>
<br>I have a strong background in linguistics, including a bachelors degree:
<br>MA Linguistic Studies with Distinction (German / Italian), University of Glasgow 2021.
<br>This included a first-year course on low-level programming using an emulated assembly language.
<br>
<br>I have found that the best way to learn programming is to work with a problem slightly above my skill level.
<br>To that end, my current code projects are:
<br>C++ → A console application to display the notes of a musical scale based on user input
<br>C++ → A low-level version of the above, with goto loops instead of classes
<br>C++ & Python → A hybrid application to take user input in C++ and produce a csv file, to be processed with numpy and pandas in Python
<br>C++ ^ Python → A simplified demographics tool to compare the size and population of a given country with its urban population
<br>....
<br>
<br>My learning goals for the next year include polishing my C++ skills and practicing with the numpy and pandas packages for Python.
<br>Future / job dependent goals:
<br>- learning the HTML-Js-CSS package for web development
<br>- learning PHP and SQL
