Hallo, I'm Ewan.

I'm a semi-selftaught C++ programmer with an interest in game design.

My background is in linguistics: MA Linguistic Studies with Distinction (German / Italian), University of Glasgow 2021.


Current code projects:
C++ → A console application to calculate the notes of a musical scale
C++ → A low-level version of the above with goto instead of conventional loops
C++ & Python → A hybrid application to take user input in C++ and produce a csv file, to be processed with numpy and pandas in Python
C++ ^ Python → A simplified demographics tool to compare the size and population of a given country with its urban population

My goals for the next year are polishing my C++ skills to an employable level
and learning the numpy and pandas packages for Python.

Future / job dependent goals:
- learning the HTML-Js-CSS package for web development
- learning PHP and SQL
