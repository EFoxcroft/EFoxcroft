Hallo, I'm Ewan.
<br>
<br>I'm a semi-selftaught C++ programmer with an interest in game design.
<br>
<br>My background is in linguistics: MA Linguistic Studies with Distinction (German / Italian), University of Glasgow 2021.
<br>
<br>Current code projects:
<br>C++ → A console application to calculate the notes of a musical scale
<br>C++ → A low-level version of the above
<br>C++ & Python → A hybrid application to take user input in C++ and produce a csv file, to be processed with numpy and pandas in Python
<br>C++ ^ Python → A simplified demographics tool to compare the size and population of a given country with its urban population
<br>
<br>My goals for the next year include polishing my C++ skills and learning the numpy and pandas packages for Python.
<br>
<br>Future / job dependent goals:
<br>- learning the HTML-Js-CSS package for web development
<br>- learning PHP and SQL
